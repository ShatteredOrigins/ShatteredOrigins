## Past ##
Panda's are known for their unique colors. There was a time when panda's ruled over the bamboo forests. They had plenty of food supply to last thousands of years until one day, **HUMANS** had stolen their bamboo and their children.

Will they take back what was theirs or will they become entertainment for the humans.
