# ShatteredOrigins #
## Information ##
**ShatteredOrigins** is a semi-vanilla minecraft server that allows crossplay where both Java and Bedrock Edition players to join the server.
Our server is currently based off of the Java mod called **Origins** which allows players to choose premade custom origins with their premade abilities.
The server is currently running 24/7 unless we have to update some plugins or fix a bug on the server.
We are looking for more players to join our server so that our server may live to see another Season.
If you are interested in joining our minecraft server, please join the discord server down below.

## What Do We Offer ##
- Well to start off with, our server offers 24/7 support which means, our server will not turn off unless we stop the server manually or if we can no longer pay for the server.
- We offer crossplay which means, Bedrock player's can also join the server.
- We have a ticket system on our discord server which works perfectly fine.
- We also minecraft linking meaning, you have to link your discord account to the minecraft server in order to play and must be in the discord server to join the minecraft server.
- Our server also supports **Partnerships**.

## What We Can't Offer ##
> [!WARNING]
> Please do not open a ticket or complain about the following offers we can not complete down below.
- We do not offer cracked support. This is because cracked accounts are basically pirated version of Java Edition and are against **Minecraft's Terms Of Service**.
- Enabling cracked support on a Java server comes with so many problems, one of those is someone raiding us.
- If we were to enable cracked support, random player's can login to our staff accounts and our server will think they are us and raid us and destroy our server.
- Next, sometimes we can't offer a active server since some of us are in different timezones or some of us got lifes to attend too.
